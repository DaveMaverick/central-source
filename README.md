The Hyperthrust Free Software Project

#### Why the name Hyperthrust?
Because one of the Core-Developers is a fan of a vintage 80's TV Show "Streethawk" ;-)

#### Why Feesoftware and not OpenSource?
We love OpenSource but the GNU Freesoftware philosophy fits better to our Project.

#### Project Objectives
* Provide a Freesoftware Groupware and Communicationserver platform for Posix and Non-Posix Operatingsystems
* Maximum security and codequality to the best of our abilities plus constant learning and improvement.
* Democratic community process (nobody is the boss, but final decisions are made by the community elected Core Development Team)
* Everybody has the Freedom to use and modify our work as you want (within the rules the GNU GPL license defines)
* We follow a TDD and Regressiontesting approach to verify the code and scaleability.
* Embedded LUA-Scripting within the Core-Serversystem to allow custom user Scripts.
* Providing easy to use API' and proper SDK's for C/C++. C#, Delphi/Lazarus, VB-Script and LUA

#### How you can contribute?
* You can test the stability of the Software, hunt and trackdown bugs
* Report any Issue (please file an issue if you find a bug, a usability problem ect)
* Help each  other to solve Problems in a friendly and cooperative manner.
* Recommend our Project if you like it ;-)

#### Non-Depedency policy
* The first approach to implement a feature is allways to implement it ourselfs, without the need of thirdparty libs and code.
* We support Open Standards as SMTP, IMAP, OPUS, TLS, AES and Diffie-Hellman
